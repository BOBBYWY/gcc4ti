HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL GCC4TI FROM SOURCE
============================================

Please note: read README.linux first. The instructions below apply only to
compiling and installing the whole package from source if you need to do that. I
recommend installing from binaries if possible.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

You must have the following programs before you attempt
to install gcc4ti-unix.

REQUIRED:
	1. gcc 2.95 or later (other compilers might work, but are NOT supported)

	2. binutils 2.8 or later (gnu or equivalent --
	   ld, ar, as, etc.)

	3. gnu patch (Solaris patch will NOT work)

	4. bzip2 (to decompress this archive)

	5. tar (gnu tar is best, but Solaris and SGI should be okay)

	6. gnu make

	7. At least 130 MB of free space (archive expands to over 80,
	build can take another 30-40 depending upon architecture)

	8. bison or yacc

	9. flex

OPTIONAL:
	10. Windows or WINE to compile the documentation from source
	    (optional: the source distribution includes pre-generated HTML
	    documentation)

	11. A dialog executable (any of: kdialog, xdialog, gdialog, cdialog or
	    dialog), if and only if you want to use the wizard (optional: the
	    wizard now uses plain bash if no dialog executable is available)

If you run into any problems, please contact me and let me know
where the install failed...

If you want to recompile GCC4TI-Linux, you will need to dowload:
	gcc-core-4.1.2.tar.bz2 (gcc-core, full gcc may not compile !)
	binutils-2.16.1.tar.bz2

Depending on your machine, compilation can take some time !


INSTALLING GCC4TI FOR UNIX
-------------------------

The installation should be very simple. The package has worked on
Linux, Solaris 8, and SGI IRIX 6 to try and make the scripts
compatible. UN*X provides some things better, some things worse. Let us know
if you have a problem with the worse...

First, extract the source to a directory of your choosing such as /tmp.

Unpack binutils & gcc-core packages to the download/ directory as this, and
create symlinks download/gcc.ti and download/binutils.ti pointing to them:

	mkdir /tmp/gcc4ti-src
	cd /tmp/gcc4ti-src
	# substitute the directory you are using for /tmp
	bunzip2 gcc4ti-src.tar.bz2
	tar xfv gcc4ti-src.tar
	mkdir download
	cd download
	bunzip2 binutils-2.16.1.tar.bz2 gcc-core-4.1.2.tar.bz2
	tar xvf binutils-2.16.1.tar
	tar xvf gcc-core-4.1.2.tar
	ln -s binutils-2.16.1 binutils.ti
	ln -s gcc-4.1.2 gcc.ti
	cd ..

At this point, you have 2 options:

1. Use the installation wizard
------------------------------

All you need to do now is:
	cd scripts; ./Install
and follow the instructions. If you want a text-mode install on a system with
KDE installed, you can use:
	cd scripts; DIALOG=dialog ./Install
to tell the script to use the text-mode (curses) dialog instead of kdialog.

You will be prompted for:
* the destination directory you want to install GCC4TI to ($TIGCC)
* the bootstrap compiler ($CC) you want to compile GCC4TI with (usually "gcc")
* the optimization flags ($CFLAGS) you want to compile GCC4TI with (read the GCC
  documentation or just use the defaults)

The wizard will ask you whether you want to apply the GCC4TI patch. The answer is
usually "Yes". It will be "No" only if you are rebuilding the same source for a
second (or more) time.

When done, the wizard will ask you whether you want to add your $TIGCC setting
to bashrc. If you answer "Yes", you are done here, you only need to restart
bash. If you prefer to do things by hand, answer "No" and follow the
instructions in section 2.1 below. (If you selected "No", but changed your mind,
you can also run envreg by hand afterwards.)

2. Use the install scripts directly
-----------------------------------

2.1. Environment variable settings
----------------------------------

Now, set the environment variable TIGCC to the directory you want to install
GCC4TI into (for example /usr/local/share/gcc4ti). You need to set this variable
in your profile, because the compilation stage needs it to find some tools and
tigcc front-end needs it to find the header files.

If you use bash, add it to your .bashrc file in your home
directory. You could also use your .profile or .login if
you have those. If you use tcsh or csh, put it in your
.cshrc file (or if you use .tcshrc, put it there).

I've never used korn shell. You're on your own if you do.

For bash/sh users

	export TIGCC=/usr/local/share/gcc4ti
	export PATH=$PATH:$TIGCC/bin

For csh/tcsh users

	setenv TIGCC /usr/local/share/gcc4ti
	set path=($path $TIGCC/bin)

I've had problems using setenv to reset the path in tcsh.
setenv path "$path ${TIGCC}/bin"
doesn't seem to work.

You may need to logout and log back in for that to take
effect. Or you can resource your profile.

	source ~/.profile
	source ~/.bashrc
	source ~/.cshrc
	source ~/.tcshrc

You only need to resource the file you changed.

2.2. Installation
-----------------

The hard part should be over. Now, just change into the directory
you extracted GCC4TI into

	cd /tmp/gcc4ti-src

Optionally, you can now rebuild the HTML documentation from source: the required
source code is in tigcclib/doc/source.tar.bz2 in your source tree. See the last
section below for instructions to compile the documentation. Note that the tools
to compile the documentation from source are for Windows only, so you will need
Windows or WINE if you want to build the documentation from source. Unless of
course you manage to port the Delphi sources of those tools yourself.
Note that it comes precompiled, so you need not do this. (As for platform-
independence: the documentation is "compiled" into platform-independent HTML
files, so compiling it from source should usually not be necessary.)

And run the installation script...

	export CFLAGS='-Os -s'
	cd scripts; ./Install_All

Assuming you have all the required tools, you should have yourself
a GCC4TI build in 5 - 60 minutes.

I hope this installation goes smoothly for you.

2.3. ALTERNATE WAY for installation
-----------------------------------

The following is the "hard" way to do step 2.2. It is used primarily for
development purposes. You can use this if you experience some problems with the
automated script.

At first, you will have to register a variable depending on the location you
want to install GCC4TI

	export TIGCC=/usr/local/share/gcc4ti
	export PATH=$PATH:$TIGCC/bin
	export CFLAGS='-Os -s'

Next, simply go into the scripts directory.
Then you must apply the patch supplied with this package:

	./Install_step_1

Next, compile binutils and gcc. This may take a while...

	./Install_step_2

If everything went correctly, you now should have a working GCC4TI for Linux
compiler. For installing the TIGCC library, simply launch:

	./Install_step_3

If you want to be able to use it, you should add /usr/local/share/gcc4ti to
your PATH. The compiler is named m68k-coff-gcc, to avoid namecollision with
your system's gcc. The other utilities follow the same naming.

You need the TI-68k Developer Utilities (several are required for using the
tigcc front-end). Simply do:

	./Install_step_4

At last, you have to install the full documentation by

	./Install_step_5


REBUILDING THE DOCUMENTATION FROM ITS TRUE SOURCE (REQUIRES WINDOWS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is lifted from Sebastian's Readme.txt accompanying the Windows
source release. Note that the Linux/Unix source release includes pre-generated
HTML documentation, so you only need to rebuild it if you modify the hs? files.

First, modify the file HelpSystem.ini in the 'Programs' subfolder of the
'Doc' folder to reflect your actual folder names. It exists so that the
'Programs' folder can reside at any given place on the hard disk.
Then, you need to call all 'Update...' programs once.

UpdateInclude.exe and UpdateInfo.exe take one or more complete file name(s)
as parameters. The actual names of the files are discarded, and the remaining
folder name is the folder to be updated. If the first parameter is '/ALL' or
no parameters are specified, all folders are updated, and in case of
UpdateInclude.exe, a header file index is generated.

UpdateKeywords.exe and UpdateIndex.exe do not take any parameters.

To compile the documentation, download the HTML Help Workshop from
http://msdn.microsoft.com. Then compile the project in the 'System\CHMFiles'
folder.

Tools to make editing help system files more convenient are also included in
this distribution.

A tools to create help system files from the original GNU Texinfo documents
is included as well, but it might need a recompilation to work with future
versions of the documentation. Anyway, the .texi files should be in the
current directory, and you should specify one of them in the command line.
The appropriate subfolders need to exist (e.g. gnuexts).

If you need detailed information about the file formats, look at the
Readme.txt file in the documentation folder.

When done with building the CHM documentation, you can convert it to the QT
assistant format using my converters:
cd srcdir/doc/converter # substitute the directory you are using for srcdir
gcc -Os -s -Wall -W -Wwrite-strings chm2dcf.c -o chm2dcf # compile chm2dcf
cd ../html
../converter/chm2dcf # convert the CHM to a Documentation Content File (DCF)
../converter/dcf2adp # convert the DCF to an Assistant Document Profile (ADP)
(There is also a script called updatedoc to automate the copying and
converting of the documentation.)
WARNING: chm2dcf is slooooow. You have been warned.
