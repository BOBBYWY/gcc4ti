[Description]
Allocates memory at the high end of the heap and returns a pointer to the allocated block.

[Explanation]
HeapAllocPtr performs <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/HeapAllocHigh)">HeapAllocHigh</A>, but instead of the handle, it returns
a pointer to the allocated block (<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/NULL)">NULL</A> in a case of error). It also
gives a necessary information to the heap manager which is needed later for deallocating
the memory using <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/HeapFreePtr)">HeapFreePtr</A> command. This routine is principally
equivalent to ANSI C <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/malloc)">malloc</A> function, so it is aliased here also as
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/malloc)">malloc</A>.

<B>Note:</B> If somebody is interested in it, the handle of the allocated block is stored two
bytes below the address returned by HeapAllocPtr.
