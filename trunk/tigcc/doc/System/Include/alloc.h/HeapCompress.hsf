[Description]
Compresses the heap.

[Explanation]
HeapCompress coalesces all used heap blocks, deleting any free blocks from the
heap if possible. If there are any locked blocks, the heap may remain fragmented.
This routine is called automatically by the system whenever it is needed
and usually should not be called by applications.
