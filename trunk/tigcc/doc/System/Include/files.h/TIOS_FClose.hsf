[Description]
Close a file.

[Explanation]
FClose closes the file <I>fsPtr</I>. This is required for files opened in WRITE mode. For files in
READ mode, FClose just updates the <I>fsPtr</I>->fileMode and <I>fsPtr</I>->fileStatus fields in the <A HREF="$$LINK(files.h/FILES)">FILES</A> structure.
<BR><BR>
<I>fsPtr</I> is a pointer to a <A HREF="$$LINK(files.h/FILES)">FILES</A> structure that was previously opened with <A HREF="$$LINK(files.h/TIOS_FOpen)">FOpen</A>.
<BR><BR>
FClose returns <A HREF="$$LINK(files.h/FileStatusEnum)">FS_OK</A> if the file was successfully closed. There is extra overhead required
for a file that is always kept around by the file system and so closing a
file will only return an error if the file or the heap has been damaged.
