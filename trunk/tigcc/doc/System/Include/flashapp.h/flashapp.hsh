Note: this header is currently VERY incomplete.<BR>
On AMS 2.xx and 3.xx, FlashApps enable tighter integration to AMS than ASM
programs enable: FlashApps can extend AMS, e.g. by exporting multiple TI-BASIC
functions, and override various aspects of AMS (e.g. the language, or the font
used by character drawing functions).<BR>

TIGCC and GCC4TI cannot currently generate FlashApps.
