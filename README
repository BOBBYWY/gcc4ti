Building and installing GCC4TI from Git:
========================================

* After cloning the repository, building and installing GCC4TI is a matter of
executing the "updatesrc" script located in the trunk/tigcc-linux/scripts
folder, and then executing the install script:

$ cd trunk/tigcc-linux/scripts
$ ./updatesrc
(abort now and create a ticket if errors mentioning e.g. cp, rm, tar appear
during the execution of updatesrc)
$ cd ../gcc4ti-0.96b11
$ scripts/Install
Caution: the build of GCC 4.1.2 is known to work with GCC 4.3 to 4.9, but
known to fail with GCC 5.2.

* You may also want to build a tarball that you can transfer to another
computer and install later. It's the "gcc4ti_src.tar.bz2" file mentioned in
the trunk/tigcc-linux/INSTALL file:

$ cd trunk/tigcc-linux/scripts
$ ./updatesrc
$ ./package_src
Then, on the target computer, you can proceed as described in the
trunk/tigcc-linux/INSTALL file, which is, basically:
    * copy, or symlink, to the build directory, the files whose path in the
      GCC4TI repository is:
pool/b/binutils-2.16.1.tar.bz2
pool/g/gcc-core-4.1.2.tar.bz2
    * run scripts/Install
