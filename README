Building and installing GCC4TI from Git:
========================================

Before being able to extract the "gcc4ti_src.tar.bz2" file mentioned in the
trunk/tigcc-linux/INSTALL file, you need to build that file.

Two scripts located in the trunk/tigcc-linux/scripts folder take care of
this:
1) updatesrc
2) package_src

After several minutes (updatesrc is lengthy), upon successful execution of
those scripts, the gcc4ti_src.tar.bz2 file will have been built into the
trunk/tigcc-linux/gcc4ti-sources folder.

You can now copy it to a new folder, and proceed as described in the
trunk/tigcc-linux/INSTALL file :)
