<HR>
<P>In addition to the <A HREF="gnuasm.html">GNU Assembler</A>, the GCC4TI package also includes
the A68k assembler by Charlie Gibbs (slightly modified Amiga version). Although GCC4TI also includes
the GNU assembler used by GCC, A68k is included here because many old assembly programs for the
TI-89 and TI-92+ are created with this assembler (so including it in the package allows compiling
existing ASM programs as well), and because, while it is inferior to the GNU assembler in some
aspects, it also has advantages, mainly easier syntax, but also support for binary include files for
example.
The A68k assembler was developed long before the TIGCC and GCC4TI projects were even started, so it
is somewhat inconsistent with the rest of the project, though some effort has been made to integrate
it into TIGCC/GCC4TI. For example, you can now call a function from a static library using a simple
<CODE>bsr</CODE> or <CODE>jsr</CODE> instruction.
<BR><BR>
This assembler comes with its own set of header files. All of them are included mainly for
compatibility reasons (note that some of them are deprecated, obsolete, inconsistent
or even obscure), so they will not be described here. Information about them may be
found in various ASM tutorials for TI-89 and TI-92+ (also deprecated, but note that
nearly 95% of all ASM programs for TI-89 and TI-92+ are written using a now deprecated
way, because a lot of information about the system was not available at the time
when these programs were created). We recommend using only <CODE>OS.h</CODE>, which contains a
list of equates for <CODE>ROM_CALL</CODE>s (but the <CODE>ROM_CALL</CODE> macros are not very
optimized and should thus be avoided), and functions from TIGCCLIB, which need no header file at all
(for example, <CODE>bsr GrayOn</CODE> is enough to call the <A HREF="gray.html#GrayOn">GrayOn</A> function). What will be presented here is the original A68k documentation, written by Charlie Gibbs himself. We have however annotated it in some places
to reflect the changes made in recent versions, and we have added 2 chapters: the list of
supported assembler directives, which was missing, and the history, which was kept in a separate file.</P>

A68k - a freely distributable assembler for the Amiga<BR>
by Charlie Gibbs<BR>
with special thanks to<BR>
Brian R. Anderson and Jeff Lydiatt<BR>
The current versions are now part of the GCC4TI project.
As such, they will be aimed much more at development for the TI-89, TI-89T,
TI-92+ and V200 calculators than at the Amiga.
Modifications of this document are marked with <B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B><BR>
(Version 2.71.F3z - July 29, 2009)
</B></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> This program is Freely Distributable, as opposed to Public
Domain.  Permission is given to freely distribute this program provided no
fee is charged, and this documentation file is included with the program.
<BR><BR>
This assembler is based on Brian R. Anderson's 68000 cross-
assembler published in Dr. Dobb's Journal, April through June 1986.
I have converted it to produce AmigaDOS-format object modules, and
have made many enhancements, such as macros and INCLUDE files.
<BR><BR>
My first step was to convert the original Modula-2 code into C.
I did this for two reasons.  First, I had access to a C compiler, but
not a Modula-2 compiler.  Second, I like C better anyway.
<BR><BR>
The executable code generator code (GetObjectCode and MergeModes)
is essentially the same as in the original article, aside from its
translation into C.  I have almost completely rewritten the remainder
of the code, however, in order to remove restrictions, add enhancements,
and adapt it to the AmigaDOS environment.  Since the only reference book
available to me was the AmigaDOS Developer's Manual (Bantam, February
1986), this document describes the assembler in terms of that book.</P>

<H2><A NAME="restrictions"><U>Restrictions</U></A></H2>
<P>Let's get these out of the way first:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>The verification file <B>'-v'</B> option is not supported.  Diagnostic
messages always appear on the console.  They also appear in the
listing file, however (see extensions below).  You can produce
an error file by redirecting console output to a file - the
line number counter and final summary are displayed on stderr
so you can still see what's happening.
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
<B>WARNING:</B> The new -v switch introduced in v.2.71.F3c is <B>NOT</B> the same as this one!</TD></TR></TABLE></P></LI>
<LI><P>The file names in the <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> directory list <B>'-i'</B> must be
separated by commas.  The list may not be enclosed in quotes.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Labels assigned by <CODE>EQUR</CODE> and <CODE>REG</CODE> directives are case-sensitive.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Strange things will happen if your source code (including
<CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files and macro expansions) exceeds 32,766 lines.
Tough darts.  Break up your source file.  Can you actually
read that monster?
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
The maximum has been increased from 32,766 to 2,147,483,646 for
32-bit operating systems starting from version 2.71.F3s.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></LI>
<LI><P>Directives <CODE>OFFSET</CODE>, <CODE>NOPAGE</CODE>, <CODE>LLEN</CODE>, <CODE>PLEN</CODE>,
<CODE>NOOBJ</CODE>, <CODE>FAIL</CODE>, <CODE>FORMAT</CODE>, <CODE>NOFORMAT</CODE> and
<CODE>MASK2</CODE> are not supported, and will be flagged
as invalid op-codes.
I feel that <CODE>NOPAGE</CODE>, <CODE>LLEN</CODE>, and <CODE>PLEN</CODE> should not be
defined within a source module.  It doesn't make sense to me to have to change
your program just because you want to print your listings on
different paper.  The command-line switch <B>'-p'</B> (see below) can
be used as a replacement for <CODE>PLEN</CODE>; setting it to a high value
(like 32767) is a good substitute for <CODE>NOPAGE</CODE>.  The effect of
<CODE>LLEN</CODE> can be obtained by running the listing file through an
appropriate filter.</P></LI>

<P>Now for the good stuff:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Labels can be any length that will fit onto one source line
(currently 127 characters maximum).  Since labels are stored
on the heap, the number of labels that can be processed is
limited only by available memory.
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
The maximum has been increased from 127 to 256 (for
Win32, starting from 2.71.F3a, for GNU/Linux,
starting from 2.71.F3c, for all other platforms,
starting from 2.71.F3s).</TD></TR></TABLE></P></LI>
<LI><P>The first character of a label can be <CODE>'@'</CODE> if the next character
is not numeric (this avoids confusion with octal constants).
This provides compatibility with the Lattice C compiler.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Since section data and user macro definitions are stored in
the symbol table (see above), they too are limited only by
available memory (actually, there is a hard-coded limit of
32,767 sections, but I doubt anyone will run into that one).</P></LI>
<LI><P>The only values a label cannot take are the register names -
A68k can distinguish between the same name used as a label,
instruction name or directive, macro name, or section name.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Section and user macro names appear in the symbol table dump,
and will also be cross-referenced.  Their names can be the same
as any label (see above); they will be listed separately.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>s and macro calls can be nested indefinitely, limited
only by available memory.  The message "Secondary heap
overflow - assembly terminated" will be displayed if memory
is exhausted.  You can increase the size of this heap using
the <B>'-w'</B> switch (see below).  Recursive macros are supported;
recursive <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>s will, of course, result in a loop that
will be broken only when the heap overflows.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The <CODE>EVEN</CODE> directive forces alignment on a word (2-byte)
boundary.  It does the same thing as <CODE>CNOP&nbsp;0,2</CODE>
(this one is left over from the original code).</P></LI>
<LI><P>Backward references to labels within the current <CODE>CODE</CODE> section
will be converted to PC-relative addressing with displacement
if this mode is legal for the instruction.  This feature is
disabled by the <B>'-n'</B> switch.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If a <CODE>MOVEM</CODE> instruction only specifies one register, it is
converted to the corresponding <CODE>MOVE</CODE> instruction.  Instructions
such as <CODE>MOVEM&nbsp;D0-D0,<I>label</I></CODE> will not be converted, however.
This feature is disabled by the <B>'-n'</B> switch.
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
Starting from v.2.71.F3c, this feature can now also be
disabled by using the <B>'-rm'</B> switch.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>SUB</CODE>, and <CODE>MOVE</CODE> instructions will be converted to
<CODE>ADDQ</CODE>, <CODE>SUBQ</CODE>, and <CODE>MOVEQ</CODE> respectively if possible.
Instructions coded explicitly (e.g. <CODE>ADDA</CODE> or <CODE>ADDI</CODE>) will not be converted.  This
feature is disabled by the <B>'-n'</B> switch.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>CMP</CODE>, <CODE>SUB</CODE>, and <CODE>MOVE</CODE> to an address register are
converted to <CODE>ADDA</CODE>, <CODE>CMPA</CODE>, <CODE>SUBA</CODE>, and <CODE>MOVEA</CODE>
respectively, unless (for <CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>SUB</CODE>, or <CODE>MOVE</CODE>)
they have already been converted to quick form.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>AND</CODE>, <CODE>CMP</CODE>, <CODE>EOR</CODE>, <CODE>OR</CODE>, and
<CODE>SUB</CODE> of an immediate value are
converted to <CODE>ADDI</CODE>, <CODE>ANDI</CODE>, <CODE>CMPI</CODE>, <CODE>EORI</CODE>,
<CODE>ORI</CODE>, and <CODE>SUBI</CODE> respectively (unless the address register or quick
conversion above has already been done).</P></LI>
<LI><P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
Starting from v.2.71.F3c, <CODE>ADDA</CODE> and <CODE>SUBA</CODE> (or <CODE>ADD</CODE> and <CODE>SUB</CODE>
to an address register) will now be converted to <CODE>LEA</CODE> if
possible. This feature can be disabled using the <B>'-n'</B>
switch (disables all optimizations) or the <B>'-ra'</B> switch
(disables just this single optimization).</TD></TR></TABLE></P></LI>
<LI><P>
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
Starting from v.2.71.F3c, <CODE>LEA&nbsp;n(an),an</CODE> will now be converted to <CODE>ADDQ</CODE> or <CODE>SUBQ</CODE> if
possible. This feature can be disabled using the <B>'-n'</B>
switch (disables all optimizations) or the <B>'-rl'</B> switch
(disables just this single optimization).</TD></TR></TABLE></P></LI>
<LI><P>If both operands of a <CODE>CMP</CODE> instruction are postincrement mode,
the instruction is converted to <CODE>CMPM</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Operands of the form <CODE>'0(An)'</CODE> will be treated as <CODE>'(An)'</CODE> except for
the <CODE>MOVEP</CODE> instruction, which always requires a displacement.
This feature is disabled by the <B>'-n'</B> switch.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The <CODE>SECTION</CODE> directive allows a third parameter.  This can be
specified as either <CODE>CHIP</CODE> or <CODE>FAST</CODE> (upper or lower case).  If
this parameter is present, the hunk will be written with the
<CODE>MEMF_CHIP</CODE> or <CODE>MEMF_FAST</CODE> bit set.  This allows you to produce
"pre-ATOMized" object modules.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The synonyms <CODE>DATA</CODE> and <CODE>BSS</CODE> are accepted for <CODE>SECTION</CODE> directives
starting data or <CODE>BSS</CODE> hunks.  The <CODE>CHIP</CODE> and <CODE>FAST</CODE> options (see
above) can also be used, e.g. <CODE>BSS&nbsp;<I>name</I>,CHIP</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The following synonyms have been implemented for compatibility
with the Aztec assembler:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><CODE>CSEG</CODE> is treated the same as <CODE>CODE</CODE> or <CODE>SECTION&nbsp;<I>name</I>,CODE</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>DSEG</CODE> is treated the same as <CODE>DATA</CODE> or <CODE>SECTION&nbsp;<I>name</I>,DATA</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>PUBLIC</CODE> is treated as either <CODE>XDEF</CODE> or <CODE>XREF</CODE>, depending on
whether or not the symbol in question has been defined in the current source module.
A single <CODE>PUBLIC</CODE> directive can name a mixture of internally- and externally-defined symbols.</P></LI>
</UL>

</LI>
<LI><P>The ability to produce Motorola S-records is retained from the
original code.  The <B>'-s'</B> switch causes the assembler to produce
S-format instead of AmigaDOS format.  Relocatable code cannot
be produced in this format.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Error messages consist of three parts.
The position of the offending line is given as a line
number within the current module.  If the line is within a
macro expansion or <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> file, the position of the macro
call or <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> statement in the outer module is given as
well.  This process is repeated until the outermost source
module is reached.
Next, the offending source line itself is listed.
Finally, the errors for that line are displayed.  A flag
<CODE>'^'</CODE> is placed under the column where the error was detected.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Named local labels are supported.  These work the same as the
local labels supported by the Metacomco assembler (<CODE><I>nnn</I>$</CODE>) but
are formed in the same manner as normal labels, except that
they must be preceded by a backslash (<CODE>'\'</CODE>).</P></LI>
<LI><P>The following synonyms have been implemented for compatibility
with the Assempro assembler:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><CODE>ENDIF</CODE> is treated the same as <CODE>ENDC</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>'='</CODE> is treated the same as <CODE>EQU</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>'|'</CODE> is treated the same as <CODE>'!'</CODE> (logical OR).</P></LI>
</UL>

</LI>
<LI><P>Quotation marks (<CODE>"</CODE>) can be used as string delimiters
as well as apostrophes (<CODE>'</CODE>).  Any given string must begin
and end with the same delimiter.  This allows such statements
as the following:</P>
<PRE>     MOVEQ   "'",D0
     DC.B    "This is Charlie's assembler."
</PRE>
<P>Note that you can still define an apostrophe within a string
delimited by apostrophes if you double it, e.g.</P>
<PRE>     MOVEQ   '''',D0
     DC.B    'This is Charlie''s assembler.'
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI><P>If any errors are found in the assembly, the object code file
will be scratched, unless you include the <B>'-k'</B> (keep) flag on
the command line.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The symbols <CODE>.A68K</CODE>, <CODE>.a68k</CODE>, <CODE>.a68K</CODE>, and <CODE>.A68k</CODE> are automatically
defined as <CODE>SET</CODE> symbols having absolute values of 1.
This enables a source program to determine whether it is
being assembled by this assembler, and is effectively
insensitive as to whether or not it is checked in upper case.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A zeroth positional macro parameter <CODE>'\0'</CODE> is supported.  It
is replaced by the length of the macro call (<CODE>B</CODE>, <CODE>W</CODE>, or <CODE>L</CODE>,
defaulting to <CODE>W</CODE>).  For instance, given the macro:</P>
<PRE>moov MACRO
     move.\0 \1,\2
     ENDM
</PRE>
<P>the macro call</P>
<PRE>     moov.l  d0,d1
</PRE>
<P>would be expanded as</P>
<PRE>     move.l  d0,d1
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI><P>If an <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> file doesn't generate any code and no listing
file is required (including suppression of the listing using
<CODE>NOLIST</CODE>), it won't be read again in pass 2.  The statement
numbers will be bumped to keep in proper alignment.  This
can really speed up assemblies that <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> lots of <CODE>EQU</CODE>ates.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The <CODE>ORG</CODE> directive is supported.  It works like <CODE>RORG</CODE>, except
that it takes the actual address to be jumped to, rather
than an offset from the start of the current section.
The given address must be in the current section.
As far as A68k is concerned, the only real difference
between <CODE>ORG</CODE> and <CODE>RORG</CODE> is that the <CODE>ORG</CODE> value must be
relocatable, while the RORG value must be absolute.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Branch (<CODE>B<I>cc</I></CODE>, including <CODE>BRA</CODE> and <CODE>BSR</CODE>) instructions will be
converted to short form if possible.  Shortening a branch
may bring other branches within range of shortening - this
can set up a ripple effect, and A68k may not catch all
branches that could theoretically be optimized.  Any branches
which A68k misses (there shouldn't be too many under normal
circumstances) can be displayed by specifying the <B>'-f'</B> switch
(see below).  Branch optimization is disabled by the <B>'-n'</B> switch.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The <CODE>INCBIN</CODE> directive allows the contents of any file to be
included in A68k's object code output.  Its format is the same
as the <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> directive, but the file can contain any data
at all, printable or not.  Rather than being processed as
source code by the assembler, the entire contents of the file
is copied directly to the current position in the object code
output file with no reformatting whatsoever.  The effect is
the same as if <CODE>DC</CODE> statements whose constants represent the
file's contents were inserted in place of the <CODE>INCBIN</CODE> directive.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The opcode <CODE>TTL</CODE> is accepted as a synonym for <CODE>TITLE</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A command-line option <B>'-g'</B> causes A68k to treat any undefined
symbol as <CODE>XREF</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The register list in a <CODE>MOVEM</CODE> instruction can be an
immediate operand which specifies the actual mask bits.</P></LI>

<P><B>Note:</B> This section has been written entirely by the TIGCC Team. Part of the information comes from <CODE>direct.txt</CODE> by Mathieu Lacage, but the whole text is completely rewritten and contains more details. Also, some of the directives listed here are not documented in <CODE>direct.txt</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
The <CODE>A68k</CODE> assembler supports the following assembler directives:
<BR><BR>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">arithmetic operators</TD><TD>
Arithmetic operators can be used exactly like their C counterparts, except that spaces are not allowed in an expression. But <CODE>((1+2)>>3)/4</CODE> is a perfectly legitimate <CODE>A68k</CODE> expression. Of course, you can not use anything other than <CODE>+</CODE> or <CODE>-</CODE> on labels
and you cannot use arithmetic on registers at all - you will have to use the corresponding
assembly instructions.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>INCLUDE&nbsp;&quot;<I>filename.h</I>&quot;</CODE></TD><TD>
Includes the file given as a parameter at the current source position. The file is read in as assembly source code, as if it was part of the current assembly source.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>INCBIN&nbsp;&quot;<I>filename.bin</I>&quot;</CODE></TD><TD>
Includes the binary content of the file given as a parameter as-is at the current location in the object file output. The file will <B>NOT</B> be assembled, but included as binary data.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>EVEN</CODE></TD><TD>
Forces alignment on an even address. The next instruction will be guaranteed to be placed at an even address. This is especially important for <CODE>dc.w</CODE> or <CODE>dc.l</CODE> directives, since accessing a word or longword at an odd address causes an address error.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>CNOP&nbsp;<I>displacement</I>,<I>alignment</I></CODE></TD><TD>
Forces alignment on an address which is the sum of <I>displacement</I>, which has to be even, and a multiple of <I>alignment</I>, which has to be a power of 2.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>XDEF&nbsp;<I>label</I></CODE></TD><TD>
Exports the label given as an argument to other object files or to the linker. This also allows linker directives like <CODE>xdef&nbsp;_nostub</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>XREF&nbsp;<I>label</I></CODE></TD><TD>
Imports the label given as an argument. This allows to access variables
from other object files even if the <B>'-g'</B> switch is not specified. Since GCC4TI specifies <B>'-g'</B> by default, there
is no real need for this directive.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>PUBLIC&nbsp;<I>label</I></CODE></TD><TD>
Imports or exports the label given as an argument, depending on whether it is part of the current source file or not. We recommend using <CODE>XDEF</CODE> or <CODE>XREF</CODE> instead when possible, since they clearly specify what is meant. But <CODE>PUBLIC</CODE> is useful when used in a common header file for multiple source files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>SECTION&nbsp;&quot;<I>sectname</I>&quot;</CODE></TD><TD>
Sets the section the following code will be written to. This is especially useful to make <CODE>A68k</CODE> use the same section as <CODE>GCC</CODE>: <CODE>.data</CODE>, in order to make sure the linking order of <CODE>GCC</CODE> files first is respected. (<B>Note:</B> You can deliberately <B>NOT</B> specify <CODE>SECTION&nbsp;&quot;.data&quot;</CODE> if you want the <CODE>A68k</CODE> file to be the main file.)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>BSS</CODE></TD><TD>
Specifies the section the following code will be written to as a &quot;BSS section&quot;, a section which will not be initialized at runtime, so it can contain only storage place which does not need to be initialized. Also, BSS sections are <B>not</B> allowed in <CODE>_nostub</CODE> mode.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><CODE>CSEG</CODE></TD><TD>
Creates a section called &quot;<CODE>CODE</CODE>&quot; where the code will be written to. This directive is not really useful in GCC4TI, since both code and data are written to the <CODE>.data</CODE> section by <CODE>GCC</CODE> and <CODE>GNU as</CODE>.

This declares a macro so that <CODE>macroName</CODE> can be used as if it was an instruction, with
the difference that unlike opcodes, macro names are <B>case-sensitive</B>. You can also pass
arguments to a macro. Those are referenced by a macro as <CODE>\<I>n</I></CODE>, where <I>n</I>
is the number of the argument, starting from 1. <CODE>\0</CODE> indicates the instruction size. <CODE>\@</CODE> indicates the number of the current macro, which is useful to create unique labels of the form <CODE>\@<I>label</I></CODE> or <CODE>\\@<I>localLbl</I></CODE>.
Therefore:</P>
<PRE>PUSH MACRO
     MOVE.\0 \1,-(a7)

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="smallcode"><U>The Small Code/Data model</U></A></H2>
<P>Version 2.4 implements a rudimentary small code/data model.
It consists of converting any data reference to one of the following
three addressing modes:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>    address register indirect with displacement using a
        specified address register, defaulting to <CODE>A4</CODE>
        (for references to the <CODE>DATA</CODE> or <CODE>BSS</CODE> section);</P></LI>
<LI><P>    program counter indirect with displacement
        (for references to the <CODE>CODE</CODE> section);</P></LI>
<LI><P>    absolute word
        (for absolute and 16-bit relocatable values).</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>These conversions do not take place unless a <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive is
encountered.  The <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive can take one operand, which
must be either an address register or a symbol which has been
equated (using <CODE>EQUR</CODE>) to an address register.  Register <CODE>A7</CODE> (<CODE>SP</CODE>)
may not be used.  If no register is given, <CODE>A4</CODE> is assumed.
<BR><BR>
     Conversion is done for all operands until a <CODE>FAR</CODE> directive
is encountered.  <CODE>NEAR</CODE> and <CODE>FAR</CODE> directives can occur any number
of times, enabling conversion to be turned on and off at will.
<BR><BR>
     Backward references which cannot be converted (e.g. external
labels declared as <CODE>XREF</CODE>) will remain as absolute long addressing.
All forward references are assumed to be convertible, since during
pass 1 <CODE>A68k</CODE> has no way of telling whether conversion is possible.
If conversion turns out to be impossible, invalid object code will
be generated - an error message ("Invalid forward reference") will
indicate when this occurs.
<BR><BR>
Although the small code/data model can greatly reduce the
size of assembled programs, several restrictions apply:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Small code and small data models are active simultaneously.
You can't have one without the other, since during pass 1
A68k doesn't know whether forward references are to <CODE>CODE</CODE>
or to <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE>.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Programs can consist of a maximum of two sections,
one <CODE>CODE</CODE>, the other <CODE>DATA</CODE> or <CODE>BSS</CODE>.  If you try to define
a third section, the message "Too many SECTIONs" will
be displayed.  The <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive is active only within
the <CODE>CODE</CODE> section.</P></LI>
<LI><P>While the <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive is active, external labels (<CODE>XREF</CODE>)
must be declared before they are used, <CODE>CODE</CODE> section references
must be with 32K of the current position (i.e. expressible as
PC-relative), and <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE> section references must be in the
first 64K of the <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE> section (i.e. expressible as
address register indirect with displacement).  Any instructions
which do not satisfy these requirements cannot be detected in
pass 1, so A68k has no choice but to display an error message
in pass 2 ("Invalid forward reference") which in this case
indicates that invalid code has been generated.  To properly
assemble such instructions, you can temporarily disable
conversion with a <CODE>FAR</CODE> directive, then resume afterwards
with another <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Conversion cannot be done for references between modules.
All external references must be left as absolute long.</P></LI>
<LI><P><CODE>A68k</CODE> assumes that the base register (normally <CODE>A4</CODE>) points to
the start of the <CODE>DATA</CODE>/<CODE>BSS</CODE> section plus 32768 bytes (this
assumed offset can be changed by the <B>'-m'</B> command-line parameter).
The register must be preloaded with this value before executing
any code converted by the <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive.  One way to do this
is to code the instruction that loads the register prior to
the <CODE>NEAR</CODE> directive.  Another way is to use a <CODE>MOVE.L</CODE> with
immediate mode, which is never converted.  Here are examples
of the two methods:</P>
<PRE>     LEA data+32768,a4                NEAR
     NEAR ;defaults to A4             MOVE.L #data+32768,a4
     &lt;remainder of code&gt;              &lt;remainder of code&gt;
     BSS                              BSS
data:                            data:
     &lt;data areas&gt;                     &lt;data areas&gt;
     END                              END
</PRE>

implementation.  I hope to improve it in future versions.</P>

<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
This <CODE>END</CODE> statement is no longer necessary starting

Moreover, the assembler will no longer accept an <CODE>END</CODE>
statement in include files or macros, since it did
never expect that and caused bugs.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></LI>

any previous version which may exist.  If any errors are
encountered during the assembly, this file will be scratched,
unless the <B>'-k'</B> (keep) switch is specified (see below).
Although this file is normally written in AmigaDOS format,
the <B>'-s'</B> switch (see below) will cause it to be written in
Motorola S-record format instead.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The listing file - this file is optionally created by <CODE>A68k</CODE>
and contains a listing complete with page headings (including
form feeds), generated object code, and error messages if any.
It is suitable for feeding to a printer.</P></LI>
<LI><P>An equate file - this file is optionally created by <CODE>A68k</CODE>
and consists of a leading comment line followed by <CODE>EQU</CODE>
statements, one for each symbol encountered by <CODE>A68k</CODE> whose
value is absolute.  This file is only created if the <B>'-e'</B>
command-line switch is specified (see below).</P></LI>
<LI><P>A header file - if requested, this file is read by <CODE>A68k</CODE>
immediately prior to the source code file.  It treated
exactly as if it were requested by an <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> statement
at the front of the source file, but is selected only if
the <B>'-h'</B> command-line switch is specified (see below).</P></LI>
<LI><P>Include files are selected by <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> directives within the
source file, and are inserted in the source code in place
of the <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> directive itself.  <CODE>A68k</CODE> first searches the
current directory for <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files; the <B>'-i'</B> command-line

<P>The names of the above files can be explicitly specified.
However, <CODE>A68k</CODE> will generate default file names in the following cases:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>If the <B>'-o'</B> switch is omitted, a default name will be assigned
to the object code file.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the <B>'-e'</B> switch is specified with no file name, a default

<LI><P>If the <B>'-l'</B> or <B>'-x'</B> switch is specified with no file name, a
default name will be assigned to the listing file.</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>A default name is generated by deriving a stem name from the source
code file name, and appending <CODE>'.o'</CODE> for an object code file name (<CODE>'.s'</CODE>
if the <B>'-s'</B> switch is specified to produce Motorola S-records), <CODE>'.equ'</CODE>
for an equate file name, or <CODE>'.lst'</CODE> for a listing file name.  The stem
name consists of all characters of the source file name up to the
last period (or the entire source file name if it contains no period).

These options can be given in any order.  Any parameter which is not
a switch (denoted by a leading hyphen) is assumed to be a file name;
up to three file names (assumed to be source, object, and listing file
names respectively) can be given.  A source file name is always required.
If a switch is being given a value, that value must immediately follow
the switch letter with no intervening spaces.  For instance, to specify
a page depth of 40 lines, the specification <B>'-p40'</B> should be used;
<B>'-p&nbsp;40'</B> will be rejected.
<BR><BR>
Switches perform the following actions:</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>-a</B></P><DD><P>Causes all relocs to be emitted, even PC-relative relocs
within a section. It also emits address differences in a
special TIGCC/GCC4TI-specific format. This will allow more
aggressive linker-side optimization.
</P><DT><P><B>-d</B></P><DD><P>Causes symbol table entries (hunk_symbol) to be written
to the object module for the use of symbolic debuggers.
If the switch is followed by a string of characters, only
those symbols beginning with that prefix string will be
written.  This can be used to suppress internal symbols
generated by compilers.  If the first character is an
exclamation mark (<CODE>'!'</CODE>), only symbols which do <B>not</B> begin
with the following characters are written out. Here are some examples:

branches as possible to short form (unless the <B>'-n'</B> switch is

set up a ripple effect where shortening one branch brings
another one into range.  This switch will cause <CODE>A68k</CODE> to
flag any branches that it may have missed; during pass 2
it is possible to tell this, although during pass 1 it might
not be.  If the <B>'-n'</B> switch (see below) is specified along

larger values reduces console I/O, making assemblies run
slightly faster.
<BR><BR>
If you specify a negative number (e.g.  <B>'-q-10'</B>), line numbers
will be displayed at an interval equal to the absolute value
of the specified number, but will be given as positions
within the current module (source, macro, or <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE>) rather
than as a total statement count - the module name will also
be displayed.
<BR><BR>
A special case is the value zero (<B>'-q0'</B> or just <B>'-q'</B>) - this

"<B>-v</B>&lt;<I>name</I>&gt;[,&lt;<I>value</I>&gt;]" (without spaces, and without the
quotes). Note that &lt;<I>value</I>&gt; can only be a <B>NUMBER</B> at the

version.) The default value of &lt;<I>value</I>&gt; is 1.
</P><DT><P><B>-w</B></P><DD><P>Specifies the sizes of fixed memory areas that <CODE>A68k</CODE> allocates
for its own use.  You should normally never have to specify
this switch, but it may be useful for tuning.
<BR><BR>
The first parameter gives the number of entries that the hash
table (used for searching the symbol table) will contain.
The default value of 2047 should be enough for all but the
very largest programs.  The assembly will not fail if this
value is too small, but may slow down if too many long hash
chains must be searched.  The hashing statistics displayed by
the <B>'-y'</B> switch (see below) can be used to tune this parameter.
I've heard that you should really specify a prime number for
this parameter, but I haven't gone into hashing theory enough
to know whether it's actually necessary.
<BR><BR>
The second parameter of the <B>'-w'</B> switch specifies the size (in
bytes) of the secondary heap, which is used to store nested
macro and <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> file information (see below).  It defaults
to 1024, which should be enough unless you use very deeply
nested macros and/or <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files with long path names.
<BR><BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC/GCC4TI)</B></TD><TD>
The default sizes are 4095,2048 in the Win32 (since
v.2.71.F3a) and GNU/Linux (since v.2.71.F3c) versions.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<BR><BR>
You can specify either or both parameters.  For example:
<BR><BR>
<TABLE CLASS="NOBORDER">
<TR><TD CLASS="NOBORDER"><CODE>-w4093</CODE></TD><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">secondary heap size remains at 1024 bytes</TD></TR>

<TR><TD CLASS="NOBORDER"><CODE>-w4093,2000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE></TD><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">increases the size of both areas</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
If you're really tight for memory, and are assembling small
modules, you can use this switch to shrink these areas below
their default sizes.  At the end of an assembly, a message
will be displayed giving the sizes actually used, in the form
of the <B>'-w'</B> command you would have to enter to allocate that much
space.  This is primarily useful to see how much secondary
heap space was used.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> All other memory used by <CODE>A68k</CODE> (e.g. the actual symbol
table) is allocated as required (currently in 8K chunks).
</P><DT><P><B>-x</B></P><DD><P>Works the same as <B>'-l'</B> (see above), except that a symbol table
dump, including cross-reference information, will be added
to the end of the listing file.
</P><DT><P><B>-y</B></P><DD><P>Causes hashing statistics to be displayed at the end of the
assembly.  First the number of symbols in the table is given,
followed by a summary of hash chains by length.  Chains with
length zero denote unused hash table entries.  Ideally (i.e.
if there were no collisions) there should be as many chains
with length 1 as there are symbols, and there should be no
chains of length 2 or greater.  I added this option to help
me tune my hashing algorithm, but you can also use it to see
whether you should allocate a larger hash table (using the
first parameter of the <B>'-w'</B> switch, see above).
</P><DT><P><B>-z</B></P><DD><P>This switch was provided to help debug <CODE>A68k</CODE> itself.  It causes <CODE>A68k</CODE> to
list a range of source lines, complete with line number and
current location counter value, during both passes.  Lines
are listed immediately after they have been read from the
source file, before any processing occurs. Here are some examples of the <B>'-z'</B> switch:

<H2><A NAME="tech"><U>Technical Information</U></A></H2>
<P>The actual symbol table entries (pointed to by the hash table,
colliding entries are linked together) are stored in 8K chunks which
are allocated as required.  The first entry of each chunk is reserved
as a link to the next chunk (or NULL in the last chunk) - this makes
it easy to find all the chunks to free them when we're finished.  All
symbol table entries are stored in pass 1.  During pass 2, cross-
reference table entries are built in the same group of chunks,
immediately following the last symbol table entry.  Additional chunks
will continue to be linked in if necessary.
<BR><BR>
Symbol names and macro text are stored in another series of linked
chunks.  These chunks consist of a link pointer followed by strings
(terminated by nulls) laid end to end.  Symbols are independent entries,
linked from the corresponding symbol table entry.  Macros are stored as
consecutive strings, one per line - the end of the macro is indicated by
an <CODE>ENDM</CODE> statement.  If a macro spans two chunks, the last line in the
original chunk is followed by a newline character to indicate that the
macro is continued in the next chunk.
<BR><BR>
Relocation information is built during pass 2 in yet another
series of linked chunks.  If more than one chunk is needed to hold one
section's relocation information, all additional chunks are released
at the end of the section.
<BR><BR>
The secondary heap is built from both ends, and it grows and
shrinks according to how many macros and <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files are currently
open.  At all times there will be at least one entry on the heap, for
the original source code file.  The expression parser also uses the
secondary heap to store its working stacks - this space is freed as
soon as an expression has been evaluated.
<BR><BR>
The bottom of the heap holds the names of the source code file
and any macro or <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files that are currently open.  The full path
is given.  A null string is stored for user macros.  Macro arguments
are stored by additional strings, one for each argument in the macro
call line.  All strings are stored in minimum space, similar to the
labels and user macro text on the primary heap.  File names are
pointed to by the fixed table entries (see below) - macro arguments
are accessed by stepping past the macro name to the desired argument,
unless NARG would be exceeded.
<BR><BR>
The fixed portion of the heap is built down from the top.  Each
entry occupies 16 bytes.  Enough information is stored to return to
the proper position in the outer file once the current macro or
<CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> file has been completely processed.
<BR><BR>
The diagram below illustrates the layout of the secondary heap.</P>

<B>Version 2.71.F3e (Kevin Kofler, August 3, 2001)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Bugfix: The SUB-&gt;LEA optimisation did not change the
sign of the immediate value.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71.F3d (Kevin Kofler, July 28, 2001)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Bugfix: The ADD(A)/SUB(A)-&gt;LEA and LEA-&gt;ADDQ/SUBQ
optimizations caused &quot;Pass 1 / Pass 2 phase
errors&quot; if an optimization was known to be
possible only in pass 2 (i.e. if using forward
references to labels in the instruction). A68k
will not try to optimize those anymore. Maybe a
future version will provide support for this kind
of optimization, but it is very difficult to
implement.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bugfix: A68k did not compile correctly on Visual C++
because I had done a define in an incorrect way.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71.F3c (Kevin Kofler, July 20, 2001)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Applied a few patches submitted by Paul Froissart:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A few more adaptations for compiling with Microsoft
Visual C++. (Note that I still recommend using GCC for
Mingw32.)</P></LI>
<LI><P>A new command line switch:</P>
<DL>
<DT><P>-v</P><DD><P>Allows to set a variable in the command line (like
-d with GCC). The variable will be a SET, not EQU
variable. Syntax: &quot;-v&lt;name&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]&quot; (without
spaces, and without the quotes). Note that &lt;value&gt;
can only be a NUMBER at the moment. (We might
support symbols as values in a future version.)
The default value of &lt;value&gt; is 1.</P>
</DL>
</LI>
<LI><P>Improved the optimization:</P>
<UL><LI><P>made optional the optimization which changes MOVEM
with a single register to MOVE</P></LI>
<LI><P>added an optional optimization which changes ADD(A)
and SUB(A) to LEA when applicable</P></LI>
<LI><P>added an optional optimization which changes LEA to
ADDQ or SUBQ when applicable</P></LI>
<LI><P>added a command line switch which allows you to
selectively disable some optimizations:</P>
<DL>
<DT><P>-r</P><DD><P>Allows to disable specific optimizations:
<TABLE CLASS="NOBORDER"><TR><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">-rm</TD><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">Disable the MOVEM -&gt; MOVE optimization</TD></TR>
<TR><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">-ra</TD><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">Disable the ADD(A)/SUB(A) -&gt; LEA optimization</TD></TR>
<TR><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">-rl</TD><TD CLASS="NOBORDER">Disable the LEA -&gt; ADDQ/SUBQ optimization</TD></TR></TABLE>
You may use more than one -r switch (as in
&quot;-rm -ra&quot;) or combine them into a single switch
(as in &quot;-rma&quot;).
You can still use -n to disable ALL optimizations
(even those not covered by -r).</P>
</DL>
</LI></UL>
</LI>
<LI><P>Added 2 more synonyms:</P>
<UL><LI><P>SLO = SCS</P></LI>
<LI><P>SHS = SCC</P></LI></UL>
</LI>
<LI><P>The END directive is now optional. If you do not use
it, the assembly will automatically end at the end of
your source file.</P></LI></UL>
</LI>
<LI><P>Also fixed a bug found by Paul Froissart involving the
reporting of invalid flags with the SECTION directive.
(Not that anyone would use those flags anyway.)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Adapted and applied a very old patch by John Antonishek,
which allows you to define a symbol as XDEF even if it
has been declared as XREF before. This is especially
useful when using a common include file for globals.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Moreover, END is not allowed in macros or include files
anymore since that was causing a few bugs because A68k
simply did not expect anyone to use it there. The
quickest remedy is to simply remove the END instruction,
since it is now optional anyway.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71.F3b (Kevin Kofler, July 12, 2001)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Bugfix: Now raises an error if an undefined local label is
used.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bugfix: Branches coded with an explicit length (.W or .L)
are not optimized (or flagged as optimizable)
anymore.<BR>
(In previous versions, .B or .S was not optimized,
but .W or .L could be optimized to a short branch.
Now, only branches without an explicit length will
be optimized.)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bugfix: Quoted strings can now be passed as macro
arguments without the need for '&lt;' and '&gt;', even
if they contain spaces or separators (',' or ';').
You can still use '&lt;' and '&gt;', for example in
order to pass strings like &lt;129,' version'&gt; (which
will appear as &quot;� version&quot; on a TI-89/92/92+).</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71.F3a (Kevin Kofler, July 9, 2001)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Win32 port for the TIGCC project, compiled with GCC for
Mingw32.<BR>
Even though we recommend Mingw32, A68k should also compile
with Microsoft Visual C++, thanks to Paul Froissart.
(Please do NOT ask me questions about compiling with
Visual C++. I have just put in Paul Froissart's ifdefs.)
It also compiles with Cygwin, but since the result is
larger than the Mingw32 version, I do not see any benefit
in using it.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bugfix: My Win32 port of v.2.71.F3 did not support labels
or variable names which contain accented
characters.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bugfix: Now detects all errors in include files. All
include files will be treated in pass 2 if an
error is detected.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bugfix by Paul Froissart: fixed a random crash bug due to
a missing initialization</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bugfix by Julien Muchembled: allow odd displacements for
words and longwords if the
resulting address might be
even</P></LI>
<LI><P>The Win32 version is now less greedy with the memory, so
its limitations are less annoying:</P>
<UL><LI><P>lines can now be 256 bytes long (Paul Froissart)</P></LI>
<LI><P>filenames (with path) can now be 259 bytes long (the
Win32 maximum)</P></LI>
<LI><P>the default heap sizes have also been increased (Paul
Froissart)</P></LI></UL>
</LI>
<LI><P>Added the following synonyms:</P>
<UL><LI><P>BLO = BCS</P></LI>
<LI><P>BHS = BCC</P></LI>
<LI><P>DBLO = DBCS</P></LI>
<LI><P>DBHS = DBCC</P></LI>
<LI><P>ROLX = ROXL</P></LI>
<LI><P>RORX = ROXR</P></LI></UL>
</LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71.F3 (David Ellsworth, July 11, 2000)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Fixed a bug introduced by my modifications that prevented
branches from being optimized in Global XRef mode.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71.F2 (David Ellsworth, January 22, 1998)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Made A68k properly differentiate between PC-relative and
absolute references to external symbols. Allowed branches
to reference external labels in Global XRef (-g parameter)
mode.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71.F1 (David Ellsworth, January 7, 1998)</B></P>
<UL><LI><P>Made changes so that combinations of EQU, XREF, and XDEF
directives work better together. These changes were made in
order for Fargo II library linking to be easier to do.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The F1 stands for Fargo patchlevel 1.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.71 (Charlie Gibbs, April 16, 1991)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.62 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Enforcer checks were being generated if command-line
parameters that took a numeric value had no value or
the value was invalid.  CalcValue was attempting to
look up a label in the symbol table, which having not
been allocated yet was causing a null pointer to be
dereferenced.  (Patrick Quaid)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Function prototyping has been added.  All function
prototypes are in a new include file, protos.h, which
is included by A68kdef.h.  Prototyping can be disabled
(for compilers which do not support it) by defining
the symbol __NOPROTO; in this case old-style function
declarations are generated instead.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.70 (Charlie Gibbs, February 25, 1991)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.62 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The definition of tempstr in WriteSymTab (24 bytes)
was being overrun in some cases, causing A68k to hang.
Its length has been increased to MAXLINE.
(Paul Gittings, John Antonishek)</P></LI>
<LI><P>If A7 was in a list of registers in the source operand
of a MOVEM instruction, all registers would be moved
(i.e. the mask was set to 0xFFFF).  (Risto Kaivola)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Octal or binary values that set bit 31 were being
flagged as overflow errors.  (Harvey Taylor)</P></LI>
<LI><P>ORGs were unnecessarily restricted when the -s flag was
specified.  Everything should be absolute when S-records
are generated, and any absolute ORG should be allowed.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A new INCBIN directive has been added.  It takes a
single operand, a file name whose contents are
included as is at the current position in the
object code file.  (Julian Gold, Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The opcode TTL is now accepted as a synonym for TITLE.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The file mode in the creat() call in xopen() has been
changed from 1 to 0644; this provides a reasonable file
mode when compiled on a Unix system.  (Paul Gittings)</P></LI>
<LI><P>A new command-line keyword (-g) has been added.  It
causes all undefined symbols to be treated as XREF.
(Paul Gittings, Steve Hawtin (who provided the code))</P></LI>
<LI><P>All initialized fields in opcodes.c have been made global
for compatibilty with more compilers.  (Steve Hawtin)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The register list in a MOVEM instruction can now be an
immediate operand which specifies the actual mask bits.
(Paul Gittings, who provided the code)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The default value for the -q option has been changed
from 10 to 100.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.62 (Charlie Gibbs, March 19, 1990)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A new command-line keyword (-m) has been added.
It must be immediately followed by a number which
specifies the offset from the beginning of a small
data section to the base register specified in the
NEAR directive (defaulting to A4).  If this parameter
is omitted, the offset defaults to 32768 bytes.  This
parameter is meaningful only if the NEAR directive
is used.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.61 (Charlie Gibbs, January 11, 1990)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.6 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>ORG and RORG at the beginning of the program were
being processed incorrectly.  (Jukka Jarvinen)</P></LI>
<LI><P>A branch instruction to its own label, e.g.</P>
<PRE>lab	bra	lab</PRE>
<P>would cause phase errors; the instruction was
being shortened on pass 2 but not on pass 1.
(Kevin Hoare)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Labels may begin with '@' if the next character
is not numeric (to avoid confusion with octal
constants).  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Write errors now cause A68k to terminate gracefully
with an appropriate error message.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.6 (Charlie Gibbs, November 2, 1989)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.5 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>If a space is left between a file keyword and the file name
(e.g. A68k -l foo.lst foo.asm) the source file was scratched.
(E. Lenz)</P></LI>
<LI><P>All code using post-increment addressing in references to
toupper() has been reworked to avoid post-increment.  Such
code does not work correctly if toupper() is a macro.
(John K. Antonishek)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The spelling of the include files A68kdef.h and A68kglb.h
has been made correct as to case.  This simplifies porting
to case-sensitive file systems.  (John K. Antonishek)</P></LI>
<LI><P>If comments immediately follow the operands of an XDEF,
XREF, or PUBLIC statement with no intervening white space
(as in any of the following statements), A68k would hang:</P>
<PRE>	XDEF	foo;comments
	XREF	bar;comments
	PUBLIC	blah;comments</PRE>
<P>(Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Numeric values (any radix) which do not fit into 32 bits
were not being flagged.  (E. Lenz)</P></LI>
<LI><P>DC statements with no operands were not being flagged.
(E. Lenz)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The -f option was suggesting short branches where the
displacement would be zero, which is illegal.  (E. Lenz)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Branches outside the current section had the offset
set to zero.  (Matt Dillon, who provided a fix)</P></LI>
<LI><P>ADDI, ANDI, CMPI, EORI, ORI, and SUBI instructions whose
source operand was not immediate were not being flagged.
(E. Lenz)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Unary NOT of a byte or word immediate operand whose value
was negative was being flagged as a size error.
(John Aycock)</P></LI>
<LI><P>All forward branches were rejected when the NEAR
directive was active.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Single-byte immediate operands (e.g. MOVE.B #-1,(a0))
are now padded with a high-order byte of zero, rather
than being sign-extended.  (E. Lenz)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The message &quot;Error in operand format.&quot; has been changed
to &quot;Addressing mode not allowed here.&quot; in places where
the latter message is more appropriate.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the -q option species a value of zero (or no value
is given, defaulting to zero), all console output will
be suppressed except for error messages, if any.
(Matt Dillon)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The 128-byte restriction on constant length no longer
applies to the entire code generated by a single DCB
statement; statements such as</P>
<PRE>	DCB.L	64,0</PRE>
<P>can now be handled.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Forward branches are now optimized.  The occasional
instruction may be missed due to ripple effects, but
this shouldn't happen frequently.  The -f switch
will flag any such instructions.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The -d switch can now be followed by an optional
prefix string (with or without a leading !) which
specifies which symbols should or should not be
included in the symbol table dump.  (Lionel Hummel)</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.5 (Charlie Gibbs, June 18, 1989)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.42 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Upon normal termination, A68k occasionally crashed in
quit_cleanup by trying to free the relocation table twice.
(Jeff Lydiatt and D. McClelland, who worked out a fix)</P></LI>
<LI><P>MEMF_CHIP and MEMF_FAST bits were being set in the
hunk length, rather than in the hunk type.  (Richard Man)</P></LI>
<LI><P>BCHG.L, BCLR.L, BSET.L, and BTST.L were causing
phase errors.  The test to ignore the .L specification
(added in version 1.21) was being skipped in pass 1
by an optimization added in version 2.4.  (David Hankins)</P></LI>
<LI><P>PC-relative offset to a label was calculated as two bytes
too great for MOVEM instructions.  (Tony Parkhurst)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>If the length code on an opcode is not .B, .W, .L, .S,
or omitted, it will be flagged as an error.</P></LI>
<LI><P>JMP.S and JSR.S are flagged as errors.  (Jim Butterfield)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Operands of the form (xxxx).W and (xxxx).L are now
supported.  This enables absolute short or absolute
long addressing to be explicitly specified.</P></LI>
<LI><P>All optimization can be disabled by the new -n switch.
(David Hankins)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The NEAR directive can now take a single operand, which
can be any address register (or equated symbol) except
A7.  If omitted, the register defaults to A4.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Instructions of the form BTST Dn,#nn are no longer
flagged.  This obscure variant is nonetheless legal.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.42 (Charlie Gibbs, January 10, 1989)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.41 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Small code/data conversion was sometimes taking place
when no NEAR directive was active.  (Jeff Lydiatt)</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.41 (Charlie Gibbs, January 6, 1989)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.4 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The second operand of LINK instructions was
being erroneously flagged.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If a macro was used before it was defined, it
was being expanded during pass 2 but not during
pass 1, causing severe phase errors.  Attempts
to use a macro before it is defined will now
be flagged as invalid opcodes.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.4 (Charlie Gibbs, January 4, 1989)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.31 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>If comments immediately followed the operands of
a DC statement with no intervening white space,
A68k would hang.  (Ulf Nordquist)</P></LI>
<LI><P>In the following command:</P>
<PRE>a68k -w 15000 myprog.asm</PRE>
<P>the space between the -w and 15000 would cause A68k
to look for a source file called &quot;15000&quot;, and to think
that the object file is to be called &quot;myprog.asm&quot;.
When it can't find &quot;15000&quot; it would display an error
message and scratch &quot;myprog.asm&quot;.  (Jeff Lydiatt)</P></LI>
<LI><P>If an INCLUDE file that is skipped on pass 2 contains
a macro call, subsequent uses of \@ (macro sequence
number are subsequently flagged.  The macro counter
must be bumped along with the line number when
skipping an INCLUDE.  (Colin Fox, Harvey Taylor)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>ORG and RORG are now fully implemented.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The SET symbols A68k, a68K, and a68k are defined in the
same way as A68K, making it effectively case-insensitive.
(Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>MOVEM and REG now accept equated register names (EQUR)
in register lists.  (Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>INCLUDE files will now be skipped on pass 2 even when
a listing file is requested, if the listing has been
turned off by a NOLIST directive before the INCLUDE,
and is not turned on until after the end of the
INCLUDE file has been reached.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>A new switch (-f) causes forward branches (Bcc, BRA, BSR)
that could be coded as short branches (Bcc.S etc.) to be
flagged.  This flag is not considered to be an error.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A limited small code / small data model has been provided.
It is activated by a NEAR directive in the source code, and
is de-activated by a FAR directive.  External variables
must be declared at the beginning of the program, which
must consist of only two sections (CODE and DATA or BSS).
All forward data references are assumed to be PC-relative
if in the CODE section, A4-relative if in the DATA/BSS
section, and absolute word if absolute values.  Any
forward references which cannot be resolved to one of
these three in pass 2 will be flagged as errors, as will
any attempt to define more than two sections.  A4 is
assumed to point to the start of the DATA/BSS section
plus 32768 bytes, and must be loaded by a MOVE.L
instruction using immediate mode unless this instruction
is not enclosed within NEAR and FAR directives.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Miscellaneous optimizations, for speed, including:
Most of the object code generator in pass 1 is bypassed.
If GetValue gets a single term it takes a short cut.
IsOperator now uses a table look-up.
Instructions now only searches that portion of the
opcode table whose opcodes start with the same letter
as the OpCode being searched for.</P></LI></UL>

<B>Version 2.31 (Charlie Gibbs, November 30, 1988)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.3 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Even though a macro definition was being skipped
by IFxx/ENDC, its ENDM directive was still being
detected, causing spurious diagnostics.  (Harvey Taylor)</P></LI>
<LI><P>NOP was not being recognized.  When moving all
directives into the opcode table, NOL and NOLIST
were placed after NOP, rather than before.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Symbols defined in the current module and declared
as PUBLIC were not being written to the object code
file when -d was specified.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Conversion of 0(An) to (An) (implemented in version
1.2) was causing errors in the MOVEP instruction,
which requires a displacement even if it is zero.
This conversion is now disabled for MOVEP instructions.</P></LI>
<LI><P>User macros containing invalid opcodes caused A68k
to get lost when returning to the outer source file.
(Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Large values of -w (over 6000 or so) would cause
a visit from the Guru.  The work field in HashIt
was overflowing and going negative.  Changing it
to unsigned corrected the problem.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Although user macros are no longer displayed when
-q is a negative number, the calling file's name
was still being displayed at the end of the macro.</P></LI></UL>
<P>
<B>Version 2.3 (Charlie Gibbs, November 21, 1988)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>All file I/O has been rewritten to use level 1 I/O
(open, creat, close, read, write, and lseek) instead
of level 2 I/O.  A68k now does its own buffering and
unbuffering to reduce system overhead and increase speed.
(Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>All assembler directives have been incorporated into
the opcode table.  Since the opcode search now looks
up directives as well, speed is increased.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Miscellaneous code optimization for additional speed.</P></LI></UL>

The following bugs in version 2.1 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Macro definitions within an INCLUDE file were
disabling the test for skipping the file on pass 2.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Errors encountered in an INCLUDE file on pass 1
were not disabling the skip of the file on pass 2 -
the pertinent error messages could not appear.</P></LI>
<LI><P>XDEF information and optional symbol table dumps were
not being written to the object code file for any
hunks that did not contain relocatable code or data.
(Colin Fox)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>If the -q option is specified as a negative value,

<B>Version 2.1 (Charlie Gibbs, November 1, 1988)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 2.00 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Macro definitions that span two chunks of memory
were causing garbage and probably a crash when
the macro was being expanded.  Pointers were not
being handled properly when linking the two chunks.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Statements such as EQU and SET were not being flagged
as illegal forward references if referencing a label
defined on the same line, e.g.</P>
<PRE>LABEL	SET	LABEL+1</PRE>
</LI>
<LI><P>The position within macros and INCLUDE files was
sometimes out by one line when reported in error
messages (and the new feature of the -q switch).</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>If the -q option is specified as a negative value,
line numbers will be displayed as positions within
the current module (whose name is also displayed),
rather than a total statement count.  (Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>INCLUDE files can be skipped on pass 2 even if they
contain SET statements - the values of all symbols
SET in the INCLUDE file are stored (as at the end
of the file) in a separate table and are patched
when the INCLUDE file is skipped.  (Bruce Dawson)</P></LI></UL>

<B>Version 2.00 (Charlie Gibbs, October 26, 1988)</B>

The following bugs in version 1.24 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The last digit of the statement number display
(lengthened in version 1.24) was not being erased
before displaying error messages.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A68k would go into a loop if a user macro was
missing an ENDC directive.  This error is now
flagged (see below).</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The highest statement number displayed at the end of
each pass is now left on the screen.  This means that,
at the end of pass 1, you can always see how many lines
A68k will have to process in pass 2, giving an idea of
how how much longer you have to wait.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The symbol table is now built using a hashing algorithm.
This eliminates the slowdown that occurs in pass 1 as
the symbol table grows, due to the old insertion process.
(Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>If A68k terminates abnormally for any reason (such as
insufficient memory) the object file is scratched
(unless the -k option is set).  (Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Any INCLUDE files which cannot be found are flagged
as errors in pass 1, and the assembly is aborted
at the end of pass 1.  (Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Missing ENDC directives are flagged in macro expansions.
Also, missing or unpaired ENDC directives in user macros
are flagged.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If an INCLUDE file doesn't generate any code and no
listing file is required, it won't be read again in
pass 2.  The statement numbers will be bumped to keep
in proper alignment.  This can really speed up
assemblies that INCLUDE lots of equates.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI></UL>

<B>Version 1.24 (Charlie Gibbs, October 11, 1988)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 1.23 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>MOVEA to a data register was not being flagged, even
though all other invalid addressing modes were.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Attempts to ORG out of the current hunk (including
to an absolute address) were not being flagged.  (E. Lenz)</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the size of the bottom of the primary heap (symbols
and macro text) exceeded 32K, any further macro
definitions would expand as endless garbage.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the size of the bottom of the primary heap (symbols
and macro text) exceeded 64K, any further external
symbols (XDEF) would be flagged as relocatability
errors upon each reference.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Where statement numbers are displayed as fixed-length
fields, their maximum length has been increased
from 4 digits to 5.  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The PUBLIC directive has been implemented.
As with the Aztec assembler, any labels defined as
PUBLIC will be treated as XDEF if defined within

<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 1.22 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The test for a third operand was producing erroneous
error messages on instructions whose second operand

<B>Version 1.22 (Charlie Gibbs, August 31, 1988)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 1.21 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Expressions of the form R-A, where R is a relocatable
term or expression and A is an absolute term or
expression, were being flagged as relocation errors.
This was due to a bug in the routine which should
(but did not) flag expressions of the form A-R.
(David Ashley)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Instructions with three operands were not being
flagged as errors.  This can be caused by an extra
comma being typed in the instruction, as in:</P>
<PRE>	BTST #0,state+3,(a5)</PRE>
<P>The second comma should not be present.  (David Ashley)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Excess spacing has been removed from the listing file.
These changes are similar to those already made to the
console output (probably at about version 1.05).</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the first statement in the source file is TTL or
PAGE, an empty page is no longer produced at the

<B>Version 1.2 (Charlie Gibbs, July 19, 1988)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 1.12 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A reference to the label of the current instruction
was being converted to PC-relative on pass 2 but not
on pass 1.  This was causing phase errors.  The label
hasn't been added to the symbol table at the time the
instruction is processed.  Conversion to PC-relative
addressing will now not be attempted in this case,
although references to * can and will be converted.</P></LI>
<LI><P>All string-type DC statements, regardless of length,
were being treated as DC.B.  For example, DC.L 'A'
would generate only one byte of object code.
(Gerald Hull)</P></LI>
<LI><P>DC.W and DC.B statements were not being checked to
ensure that their values would fit into a word or
a byte respectively.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If a comment line had white space preceding the
asterisk, A68k would hang.  Actually, it was
interpreting the asterisk as an opcode and trying
to open a macro file called &quot;*&quot;.  Since under
AmigaDOS such a file is the console, A68k was
actually waiting for console input.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If an instruction with no operands (such as RTS
or NOP) followed MOVE.L #rel,D0 where &quot;rel&quot; was
a relocatable symbol, the RTS (etc.) would have
its nonexistent operands flagged as invalid.</P></LI>
<LI><P>SECTION names enclosed in quotes were not being
handled correctly.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Source modules that did not generate any code, data,
or BSS areas, but only defined symbols, such as</P>
<PRE>label	equ	4
	xdef	label
	end</PRE>
<P>were generating incomplete object modules.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Jeff's experimental hunk code (prefixing hunk names
with a sequence number before adding to the symbol
table) has been permanently incorporated.  It seems
to work better with BLink on programs that have
hunks continued farther on in the source code.
(Jeff Lydiatt)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The macro parameter \0, which is replaced by the
size specification in the macro call (B, W, or L,
defaulting to W) is now supported.  (Gerald Hull)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Operands of the form 0(An) will be treated as (An).

The following bugs in version 1.10 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A68k would go into a loop while processing the
arguments of a macro call, if these arguments are
followed by comments separated from the arguments
by one or more tab characters, and the -t switch
is specified on the command line.  All tests for
blanks have been replaced by calls to isspace().</P></LI>
<LI><P>The operand alignment checks added in version 1.06

<P>These instructions are now exempt from alignment checking.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A listing file name can now be specified with the
-x switch; it is no longer necessary to specify
both the -l and -x switches to produce a cross-
reference listing with a name other than the default.</P></LI>
<LI><P>DS statements with more than one operand are
flagged and ignored (in case they should be DC).</P></LI>

The following bugs in version 1.07 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>BSS sections were not being written to the object
code file except for a BSS section at the end of
a program.  This is due to a bug in the code added
in version 1.05 to overwrite null sections.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If a source module contained a mixture of lengths
(8, 16, or 32 bits) in external references (XREF)
to the same label, all references were being treated
as if they has the length of the first reference.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>DS operands that are either a forward references
or relocatable are now flagged.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Short branches (Bcc.S, including BRA and BSR) to
the next instruction (i.e. a displacement of zero)
are illegal - the processor takes the displacement
from the next word.  Attempts to generate a short
displacement of zero are now flagged.</P></LI></UL>

The following bugs in version 1.06 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Instructions that take no operands (such as RTS)
were being flagged if they had comments that were
not preceded by a semicolon.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The following synonyms have been added:</P>
<PRE>CSEG  for CODE (Aztec compatibility)

<LI><P>Strings and character values may be delimited by
either apostrophes (') or quotation marks (&quot;).
The character not used as a delimiter can be used
within the string without doubling it.  For example,</P>

<LI><P>The object code file will be scratched if any errors
were found, unless the -k (keep) flag is set.
(Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The symbol .A68K is automatically defined at the
beginning of each assembly as a SET symbol with an
absolute value of 1.  This enables programs to check
whether they're being assembled by this assembler.
(Jeff Lydiatt)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The symbol table insertion routine has been
greatly speeded up.</P></LI></UL>

The following bugs in version 1.05 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Lines skipped by IFxx/ENDC were not being counted
in the line number given in error messages.</P></LI>
<LI><P>DATA and BSS sections may be unnamed, or have names
the same as CODE sections.  Honest, I thought section
names had to be unique even across types.</P></LI>
<LI><P>CHIP and FAST options on the CODE, DATA, and BSS
synonyms for the SECTION directive were not being
handled correctly.</P></LI>
<LI><P>XDEF records and symbol table records (if desired)
were not being produced for symbols defined ahead
of the first object-code producing instruction.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The CNOP instruction can now force alignment
relative to any boundary up to 128 bytes.
The second operand must still be a power of 2.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The -q switch has been added to change the frequency
with which progress reports (current line number) are
displayed on the console.  The default remains at
every 10 lines (-q10).  If you specify -q (no interval)
or -q0 the line number displays will be suppressed.
This will make assemblies run slightly faster due to
reduced console I/O.  (Bill Henning)</P></LI>
<LI><P>The -t switch has been added to keep any tabs in the
source file when producing the listing file, as well as
generating tabs elsewhere whenever possible.  This
speeds up assemblies and gives smaller listing files,
but such listing files cannot be displayed on devices
that do not assume a tab stop in every 8th position.
(Bruce Dawson)</P></LI>
<LI><P>Any single-operand instruction with two operands,
and any no-operand instruction with any operands,
will be flagged.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Relocatable 8- or 16-bit immediate operands
will be flagged.  They blow up BLink.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Named local labels are now supported.  Their names
are formed in the same way as normal labels, but are
then preceded by a backslash.  Their scope is the
same as normal local labels (nnn$).  (Colin Fox)</P></LI>
<LI><P>An alignment error will be flagged in the following cases:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Odd displacement on a LINK instruction</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bcc or DBcc to an odd address</P></LI>
<LI><P>In any word or long-word instruction, any operand
using the following addressing modes:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Address register indirect with displacement</P></LI>
<LI><P>Address register indirect with index and displacement</P></LI>
<LI><P>Absolute short</P></LI>

<LI><P>LEA and PEA instructions are exempt from these tests.</P></LI></UL>
</LI>
<LI><P>If a section is found to contain no data, A68k will
back up to its beginning and overwrite it with the
next section.  The result is that null sections
will no longer appear in the object file.</P></LI></UL>

	SECTION	variables,BSS
	  &lt;DS statements&gt;
	SECTION	prog,CODE
	  &lt;more code&gt;</PRE>
<P>bad relocation information was being generated for
the continuation of the SECTION.  This bug was left
over from version 1.03.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>All console output except for error messages is now
sent to stderr - this enables stdout to be redirected,
producing an error file.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Console (stderr) output has been modified to require
fewer lines on the screen.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If an error occurs while expanding a macro or INCLUDE
file, the position of the call in each outer file is
given along with the position in the current (innermost)
file.  Tracing continues until the outermost file (i.e.
the original source file) is reached.</P></LI></UL>

<PRE>	xdef	label

	 .
    &lt;at least 128 bytes of object code&gt;

label:</PRE>
<P>(The XDEF was fooling A68k into thinking that &quot;label&quot;
was defined within 128 bytes of the BRA instruction
on pass 1, although on pass 2 it knew better.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the first operand of an two-operand executable
instruction contained a character term containing a
left or right parenthesis, it would generate error
messages and be incorrectly evaluated.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Labels that don't begin in column 1 (denoted by a
trailing colon) caused a Guru Meditation.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Certain ADD and SUB instructions using PC-relative
addressing may cause phase errors.  If the displacement
is in the range 1 to 8 inclusive, the instruction was
erroneously converted to ADDQ or SUBQ during pass 2.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The -z option has been added to display the
current source program line on stdout as it
is read, optionally over a given range.
This feature is provided for debugging purposes.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Bcc, BSR, and DBcc to labels in other than the current
section is now supported.  A 16-bit relocation entry
will be generated for each such reference.</P></LI>
<LI><P>PC relative mode will be generated for backward
references to labels within the current CODE section
if legal for the current instruction.  Forward
references will not be converted, since there is
no way of telling which section the label is in
during pass 1.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The cumulative sizes of all sections by type (i.e.
CODE, DATA, and BSS) will be displayed at the end
of the listing file and the console display.

<LI><P>In the symbol table dump, section names will no
longer be indicated just as SECTION, but rather
as CODE, DATA, or BSS, depending on type.</P></LI></UL>

<P>The following enhancements have been added:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A header file is now supported.  If the parameter
-h&lt;filespec&gt; is included on the command line, the
specified file will be included as if the source
file's first line was &quot; include &lt;filespec&gt;&quot;.
The file specification may include a path name,
although the include path names given by the
-i parameter (if any) will also be searched.</P></LI>
<LI><P>An equate file can now be produced.  If the parameter
-e&lt;filespec&gt; is included on the command line, a file
will be written containing EQU statements for any
symbol whose value is absolute.  If -e is specified
without &lt;filespec&gt;, the name of the file will be
formed in the same way as the list file, except with
an extension of &quot;.equ&quot;.  (Bruce Dawson)</P></LI></UL>
<P>The following changes have been made to existing logic:</P>
<UL><LI><P>No symbol table dump will be produced unless the
-x (cross-reference) switch is set.  Formerly a

<B>Version 1.01 (Charlie Gibbs, August 20, 1987)</B>
<BR><BR>
The following bugs in version 1.00 have been corrected:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Long-word constants and storage areas were being
aligned on a double-word boundary.  The only place
where double-word alignment is now forced is at a
break between SECTIONs, since the length of an
AmigaDOS hunk must be a multiple of 4 bytes.
(CNOP 0,4 can still be used if double-word
alignment is desired by the programmer.)</P></LI>
<LI><P>If a label on an END statement or the first statement
of a SECTION was named in an XDEF statement, it would
not be written to the object code file.  The latter
case includes both the label of a SECTION directive
and the label of the first executable instruction in
the absence of any SECTION directives (defaulting to
an unnamed CODE section).  In the final case (default
unnamed CODE section), references to XREF symbols
in the first statement would also not be written
to the object code file.</P></LI>
<LI><P>If the last statement in the source file was not
terminated with a newline character (premature EOF),
it was being ignored altogether.</P></LI>
<LI><P>A register list as the source operand of a MOVE
instruction was not being flagged as an error.
(MOVE to a register list was being flagged, however.)</P></LI>
<LI><P>MOVE from USP was generating incorrect code.  Also,
MOVE from SR or CCR to an address register was
generating incorrect code rather than being flagged.</P></LI></UL>
